      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <img id="bio_pic" src="assets/images/jeyson_bio_pic.jpg" alt="My picture"/>

      <p>When I was in High School I discovered that feel I the best when I am doing activities that allow me to be creative in some way. I took a photography class, painting, ceramics, and even choir. I went to college at Kansas State University and earned a degree in Pre-Art Therapy. I loved college. I loved creating art. I also love people. I had plans to for a masters degree in Art-Therapy, but then life got in the way. I got married to my wonderful wife, and planned to take off a year to save money for grad school. I never made it to grad school, but in that year I found a second love for computers. I eventually found a new career in IT, specifically desktop and network support. I enjoyed my job but it felt a little stagnate at the time, so I started looking for a change.

      Life went on and I needed to make more money to support my family when an opportunity came for a sales job with a large national moving company. I have been very successful in sales, even becoming one of the top three in the country for my brand one year. However, I have come to realize that I miss the creative side of myself. I think a part of ME is missing. I miss working with computers as well.
      </p>
      <p>Now, I am hoping to combine two of my favorite interests and start a new career in web development. I am so excited and a little nervous. It feels very strange being back on a college campus as a student after nearly 22 years. When I went to school the first time, I did not have a demanding job, a wife, and 3 wonderful daughters to share my time with. However, my family is very supportive and they know that the sacrifice is worth it. Maybe, after all this time, I will find that creative part of me that I have been missing for all these years.
