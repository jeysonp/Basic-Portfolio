      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <img id="bio_pic" src="assets/images/jeyson_bio_pic.jpg" alt="My picture"/>

      <p>When I was in High School I discovered that I feel the best when I am doing activities that allow me to be creative in some way. I took a photography class, painting, ceramics, and even choir. I went to college at Kansas State University and earned a degree in Pre-Art Therapy. I loved college. I loved creating art. I also found that I love working with people. I had plans for a masterâ€™s degree in Art-Therapy, but then my interests and priorities changed. I got married to my wonderful wife and planned to take off a year to save money for grad school. I never made it to grad school. However, in that year I found a love for computers. I eventually found a new career in IT, specifically desktop and network support. I enjoyed my job, but it felt a little stagnate at the time, so I started looking for a change.

      Life went on and I needed more income to support my family. An opportunity came along for a sales job with a large national moving company. I have been very successful in sales. I was even one of the top three residential sales people in the country for my brand in 2015. However, I have come to realize that I miss the creative side of myself. I think a part of ME is missing. I also miss working in the tech field.
      </p>
      <p>Now, I am hoping to combine two of my favorite interests and start a new career in web development. I am so excited and a little nervous. It feels very strange being back in the classroom as a student after nearly 22 years. When I went to school the first time, I did not have a demanding job, a wife, and 3 wonderful daughters to share my time with. However, my family is very supportive. They know that the sacrifice will be worth it. Maybe, after all this time, I will find that creative part of me that I have been missing for all these years.
